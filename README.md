# Goal: Get to ten points by crossing to the otherside of the road.
<br>
# Rules:
1. Cross the road. Each successful traversal to the otherside adds one point to your score. 
2. With each successful traversal the speed of the cars will change - sometimes faster, sometimes slower
3. With each failure, the player loses a life, if the player loses all of their lives before they have reached a score of ten it's game over.
4. Cross the road ten times to win

# The Fly
* If the player catches the fly instead of getting one point, the player gets two points when they cross the road.
